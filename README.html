<p>** What is WAR is a card game typically involving two players. It uses a standard French playing card deck. Due to its simplicity, it is played most often by children.? **</p>

<p>Peace is a variation of the popular children&#8217;s game WAR.</p>

<p>WAR is a card game involving two players.</p>

<p>** How is the game played? **
(source: http://www.pagat.com/war/war.html)
The 52 card deck is evenly divided between the two players (each player gets 26 cards).
Cards rank as usual from high to low: A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. Suits are ignored in this game.
Players do not look at their card.
But in PEACE the rules are flipped. Lower value wins.
Cards rank as usual from low to high: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 T J Q K A.
Each player plays the top card of their 26 card stack.
In WAR the higher card wins but in PEACE, the lower card wins.
In a turn, the winner with the lowest card, takes the cards and puts them on the bottom of their deck.
The players continue playing this way until 1 player has a full deck (56 cards). The player with all the cards is the winner of PEACE.
If a turn has each player with an equal valued card, then you have PEACE.
** When there is a tie, how PEACE works **
The tied cards stay on the table and both players play the next card of their pile face down and then another card face-up.</p>

<p>When equal cards are turned up the players play the next five cards from their pile face down, sometimes saying &#8220;P - E - A - C - E&#8221; and then turning up the next card to decide which player wins (with the lowest card) all ten cards.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have enough cards to complete the war, you lose.</p>

<p>The game continues until one player has all the cards and wins.</p>
